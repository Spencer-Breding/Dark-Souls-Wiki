# Dark Souls Wiki

This project was made in order to enhance both my frontend and backend development skills. The goal of this project is to have a functioning wiki comprised of information for the game Dark Souls.

## Frontend

The frontend of this site is being built with Next.js, HTML, and CSS.

## Backend

The backend of this site is not built yet but will use Node.js and Express.js.

## Database

The database this website will use is MongoDB.

## Note
This website is currently not being hosted and you must use npm install and npm run dev to view the website.
